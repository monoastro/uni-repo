## Practical:
Laboratory exercises should be conducted in either LISP or PROLOG. Laboratory exercises must cover the fundamental search techniques, simple question answering, inference and reasoning.

## Evaluation Scheme:
The question will cover all the chapters of the syllabus. The evaluation scheme will be as indicated in the table below:

| Chapter | Hour | Marks Distribution* |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| 1       | 4    | 7                 |
| 2       | 4    | 7                 |
| 3       | 5    | 9                 |
| 4       | 8    | 14                |
| 5       | 4    | 7                 |
| 6       | 6    | 10                |
| 7       | 14   | 26                |
| **Total** | **45** | **80**        |

*Note: There may be minor deviations in marks distribution
